This repository contains a very small demo web application for tracking a user's vehicle kilometres.

The demo provides:

- A simple login and profile page.
- Editable vehicle information.
- An inbox that receives update requests.
- A driving habits slider ranging from 0â€“140,000 km.

When the user answers an inbox update request with their current kilometres, the slider updates automatically. Previous updates are shown in the inbox and cannot be edited.

Open `index.html` in a web browser to try the example.
